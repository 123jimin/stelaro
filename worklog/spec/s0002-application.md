## Types

Types are shown erased to their widest form for readability. Implementations must be as narrow as possible — e.g. `call` accepts only references from registered components' call surfaces, with input/output types inferred from the reference.

```typescript
type LifecycleState = "idle" | "starting" | "active" | "failed" | "stopping";

type ApplicationDefinition = {
    readonly components: readonly AnyComponent[];
    readonly logger?: LoggerFactory;        // default: consoleLoggerFactory
};

type ApplicationOptions = {
    readonly argv?: string[];
    readonly config_dir?: string;
};

type Application = {
    readonly args: ParsedArgs;
    start(): Promise<void>;
    stop(): Promise<void>;
    call(reference: AnyComponentCallReference, input: unknown): Promise<unknown>;
};

function defineApplication(definition: ApplicationDefinition): ApplicationDefinition;
function createApplication(definition: ApplicationDefinition, options?: ApplicationOptions): Application;
```

## Behavior

### Core

- An application coordinates registered components, typed component calls, configuration, and logging.
- `createApplication` initializes state for each registered component that declares a state factory.
- `createApplication` computes a topological ordering of components from the `uses` dependency graph.
- `createApplication` throws `CircularDependencyError` if the dependency graph contains a cycle.
- The application creates one logger per component and provides that logger through the component's context.

### Lifecycle

- `app.start()` transitions `idle` → `starting` → `active`. Calls each component's `start` hook (if present) in topological dependency order.
- If a `start` hook throws, the application transitions to `failed`. Already-started components are not rolled back. The user must call `stop()` to clean up.
- `app.stop()` transitions `active | failed` → `stopping` → `idle`. Calls each component's `stop` hook (if present) in reverse topological order (best-effort).
- If any `stop` hooks throw, `stop()` rejects with an `AggregateError` containing all errors. The application still transitions to `idle`.
- `app.call()` only works in `active` or `reloading` states. All other states throw `LifecycleStateError`.
- `app.start()` only works in `idle`. All other states throw `LifecycleStateError`.
- `app.stop()` only works in `active` or `failed`. All other states throw `LifecycleStateError`.
- Components without lifecycle hooks are silently skipped during start/stop.

## Constraints

- Application behavior belongs to the core package.
- Application behavior must not depend on gateway-specific runtimes.
- Shared concerns stay with the application: lifecycle, configuration, logging, component registration, and typed calls.
- Application runtime state initialization must happen during `createApplication`, before any calls are dispatched.

## Anticipated Changes

- Gateway registration may be specified separately.
- Configuration loading may be specified separately.

## Dangers

- Mixing application behavior with gateway-specific routing can make the core package depend on external runtime protocols.
- Mixing reusable definition concerns with runtime state can make the public model confusing.
